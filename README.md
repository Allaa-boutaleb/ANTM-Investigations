# Refined Investigations on Aligned Neural Topic Models
On Interpretability, Topic Alignment, and Contextualized Topic Representation

Abstract of the paper:

  Dynamic topic models have seen tremendous growth in use in various domains. The Aligned Neural Topic Model (ANTM) is an algorithmic dynamic topic model that uses multiple algorithms to discover evolving topics as weighted sets of aligned clusters of semantically similar documents. This paper presents a refined investigation of ANTM that outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic topic models. Preliminary experiments show that optimizing coherence and diversity metrics alone often results in the emergence of overly large, uninformative topics. To address this issue, the ANTM model undergoes a fine-tuning process that places greater emphasis on topic counts, effectively mitigating the problem. We also conduct experiments with two extensions of ANTM, including a contextualized topic representation method and a similarity-based topic alignment technique. The results show that ANTM improves in terms of interpretability for analyzing trends in textual datasets.
